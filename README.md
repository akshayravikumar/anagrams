# Anagram finder
I love this word game called Anagrams - which requires being able to add letters to a word to create another word and "steal" it. It was my birthday, I was bored, and I coded myself a present: a website that, given a string and a number, finds all words that can be created by adding at most that many letters, and rearranging.
